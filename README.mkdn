This is my `~/.dzil/` directory, containing default profile data for CPAN
projects.

You can make use of it yourself:

    * Copy directory to `$HOME/.dzil/
    * Edit `.dzil/config.ini` appropriately
      This is your basic configuration data, such as who you are.
    * Edit `.dzil/profiles/default/plugins.ini`
      This is the outline for your project's default dist.ini plugin set.
    * Start new projects! `dzil new My-New-Project`
